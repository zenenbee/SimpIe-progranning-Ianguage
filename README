Fun facts about SPL:
It's file type is .ppl, wonder what that's named after!
SPL doesn't care about whitespace
Each chunk is 2 digits

Moves back some spots if top stack value (but doesn't run current line its on) == 0 - 10 (places to move back)
Moves forward some spots if top stack value (but doesn't run current line its on) != 0 - 11 (places to move forward)

Crash/End the program - f0 (fun value)
Dummy code - f1 (dummy value)
